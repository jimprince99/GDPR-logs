# GDPR-logs
This will remove GDPR information from logs-files. The script will parse the file, one line at at time, and replace phone numbers with anonymous phone numbers. These are phone numbers guaranteed never to be used on a live network.

The script will work for Windows machines and for Linux machines as it's an executable jar file.

There are ".sh" and ".bat" files to start the script.

An example of running the script would be 

./GDPR-logs.sh example-log-file.log

An example of running the script from a Windows box would be

GDPR-logs.bat example-log-file.log

The Zip file (GDPR-logs/GDPR-logs/GDPR-logs.zip) is all you need to download as it contains the jar file and the .sh and .bat files.
